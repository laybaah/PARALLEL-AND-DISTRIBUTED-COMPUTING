This repository contains examples and concepts from **Python Parallel Programming Cookbook**.

## Chapters Overview

### Chapter 1: Getting Started
- Introduces parallel programming models and metrics.
- Includes a multiprocessing example for shared memory.

### Chapter 2: Thread-Based Parallelism
- Explores threading and synchronization in Python.
- Covers advanced synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores and barriers.

### Chapter 3: Process-Based Parallelism
- Covers process management using the `multiprocessing` module.
- Demonstrates inter-process communication with `Queue` and `Pipe`.
- Utilizes process pools for task distribution.

### Chapter 4: Message Passing
- Implements message passing with the `mpi4py` library.
- Includes point-to-point communication and collective operations like broadcast, scatter, and reduction.

### Chapter 5: Asynchronous Programming
- Demonstrates asynchronous programming using `asyncio`.
- Explains event loops, coroutines, and task management.# PARALLEL-AND-DISTRIBUTED-COMPUTING
